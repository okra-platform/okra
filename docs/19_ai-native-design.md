# AI-Native Design in OKRA

OKRA is designed from the ground up to be AI-native, providing a single canonical way to express system concerns that makes code generation predictable, safe, and verifiable.

---

## üéØ The Problem with Traditional Systems

Traditional architectures leave AI assistants guessing:
- **Multiple frameworks** for the same concern (10+ ways to handle auth)
- **Implicit patterns** that require deep context to understand
- **Runtime configuration** that can't be statically validated
- **Switch statements and routers** that AI tends to hallucinate

This leads to:
- Inconsistent generated code
- Security vulnerabilities from misunderstood patterns
- Excessive boilerplate that obscures intent
- Difficult-to-review AI contributions

## üöÄ OKRA's AI-Native Approach

### 1. **Single Canonical Expression**
Every cross-cutting concern has exactly one way to express it:

```graphql
# Traditional: Multiple auth approaches
# ‚ùå Middleware, guards, filters, decorators, runtime checks...

# OKRA: One way
@auth(roles: ["admin"])
deleteUser(id: String): void
```

### 2. **Declarative Over Imperative**
Configuration through decorators, not code:

```graphql
# Traditional: Imperative retry logic
# ‚ùå try/catch blocks, custom retry loops, various libraries

# OKRA: Declarative
@durable(retries: 3, timeout: "5s", backoff: "exponential")
processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): PaymentResult
```

### 3. **Build-Time Validation**
AI-generated code can be validated before runtime:

```bash
# AI generates service definition
okra validate service.graphql

# Output:
‚úÖ Schema valid
‚úÖ Decorators consistent
‚úÖ Event flow verified
‚ùå Error: Non-idempotent handler cannot consume durable event
```

### 4. **No Switch Statements**
Event routing is declarative, eliminating a major source of AI hallucination:

```graphql
# Traditional: Switch-based routing
# ‚ùå AI often generates incorrect case statements

# OKRA: Declaration-based
@handles(event: "order.created")
onOrderCreated(event: OrderCreatedEvent): void
```

## ü§ñ Benefits for AI Assistants

### 1. **Less Hallucination**
With only one way to express each concept, AI can't choose wrong:
- No framework selection decisions
- No pattern matching required
- No ambiguous "best practices"

### 2. **Predictable Generation**
Given a requirement, the code structure is deterministic:

**Human**: "Add retry logic to the payment processor with admin-only access"

**AI Generated** (always the same pattern):
```graphql
@auth(roles: ["admin"])
@durable(retries: 3, timeout: "5s")
@idempotent
processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): PaymentResult
```

### 3. **Static Validation**
AI can verify its own output:
```bash
# AI can run validation as part of generation
okra validate --ai-mode service.graphql
```

### 4. **Context-Free Understanding**
Decorators are self-documenting:
```graphql
# AI doesn't need to understand the codebase to know:
# - This emits a durable event
# - It's distributed to one handler (queue mode)
# - Events expire after 1 hour
@emits(durable: true, ttl: "1h", distribution: { mode: "queue" })
orderShipped(event: OrderShippedEvent): void
```

## üìä AI Generation Examples

### Task: "Create a service that processes orders with payment"

**Traditional System** (multiple valid approaches):
```javascript
// Option 1: Express middleware
app.post('/order', authMiddleware, retryMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Process order
});

// Option 2: Class-based
@Controller()
class OrderController {
  @Post('/order')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
  @Retry(3)
  async processOrder() { }
}

// Option 3: Functional
const processOrder = withAuth(withRetry(async (req) => { }));
```

**OKRA** (one canonical way):
```graphql
service Orders @okra(namespace: "shop", version: "1.0") {
  @auth(roles: ["customer"])
  @durable(retries: 3, timeout: "10s")
  processOrder(input: OrderInput): Order
  
  @emits(durable: true)
  orderProcessed(event: OrderProcessedEvent): void
}
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Through Structure

### 1. **Type-Safe Generation**
All generated code is strongly typed:
```typescript
// Generated from IDL - AI can't get this wrong
interface OrdersService {
  processOrder(input: OrderInput): Promise<Order>;
  events: {
    orderProcessed(event: OrderProcessedEvent): Promise<void>;
  };
}
```

### 2. **Policy-Compliant by Default**
Decorators enforce policies at generation time:
```graphql
# AI knows payment methods need specific decorators
@auth(roles: ["payment-processor"])
@durable(retries: 3)
@idempotent
chargeCard(request: ChargeRequest): ChargeResult
```

### 3. **Traceable Decisions**
Every architectural decision is explicit:
```graphql
# AI's reasoning is visible in decorators:
@handles(
  event: "payment.failed",
  durable: { retries: 5 },  # AI: Payment failures need more retries
  filters: "amount > 0",     # AI: Skip invalid amounts
  idempotent: true          # AI: Safe to retry
)
onPaymentFailed(event: PaymentFailedEvent): void
```

## üîç Static Analysis for AI

OKRA enables AI to perform sophisticated analysis:

### Dependency Graphs
```bash
okra graph --format=json
# AI can analyze service dependencies programmatically
```

### Impact Analysis
```bash
okra explain order.created
# Shows all handlers, workflows, and side effects
```

### Validation Rules
```bash
okra validate --explain
# AI understands why validation failed and can fix it
```

---

## üöÄ Best Practices for AI Integration

### 1. **Prompt Engineering**
Include OKRA patterns in system prompts:
```
When generating OKRA services:
- Use @decorators for all cross-cutting concerns
- Never write switch statements for routing
- Always validate with 'okra validate'
```

### 2. **Validation Loop**
AI should always validate generated code:
```python
# AI generation loop
while True:
    code = generate_service()
    result = run_command("okra validate", code)
    if result.success:
        break
    fix_errors(result.errors)
```

### 3. **Pattern Library**
Maintain a library of validated patterns:
```graphql
# Pattern: Async Event Processing
@handles(event: "order.created", batch: { maxItems: 100 })
@idempotent
processOrderBatch(events: [OrderCreatedEvent]): void

# Pattern: Secure API Endpoint  
@auth(roles: ["api-user"])
@durable(timeout: "30s")
getData(request: DataRequest): DataResponse
```

## üé® Future AI Features

### 1. **AI-Assisted Validation**
```bash
okra validate --ai-explain
# Explains errors in natural language with fix suggestions
```

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**
```bash
okra suggest-decorators analyze-service
# AI suggests missing decorators based on method names/types
```

### 3. **Automated Testing**
```bash
okra generate-tests --ai
# Creates comprehensive tests based on decorators
```

- **One way** to express each concept
- **Static validation** of all generated code  
- **Self-documenting** decorator patterns
