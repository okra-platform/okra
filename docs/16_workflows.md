# Okra Workflow Specification

This document defines the architecture, structure, and rationale behind `okra.workflow.yaml` files. These workflows represent typed, declarative, durable execution graphs for orchestrating service calls, callbacks, AI steps, and logic ‚Äî all governed by YAML + CEL and fully inspectable by the platform.

---

## üß† Philosophy

Okra workflows:

- Are **declarative**: logic is defined in YAML, not code
- Are **governed**: logic, transitions, and schema are auditable and policy-enforced
- Are **typed**: every step has input/output schemas, enabling strong validation and developer tooling
- Are **composable**: workflows can depend on services, events, and other workflows
- Are **observable**: fully indexable, introspectable, and queryable across an org
- Are **AI-safe**: agents and callbacks provide data, but cannot dictate flow

## üìÑ File: `okra.workflow.yaml`

```yaml
name: user.onboarding
version: v1

inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    userId:
      type: string

triggers:
  - type: event
    event: user.created
    condition: "event.payload.accountType == 'pro'"

steps:
  - name: createAccount
    call:
      type: service
      target: account.create
      args:
        userId: "{{ input.userId }}"
    outputSchema:
      type: object
      properties:
        accountId:
          type: string
    saveResultAs: accountResult

  - name: waitForActivation
    waitForSignal: activated
    timeoutMs: 86400000
    onTimeout:
      next: markAbandoned

  - name: markAbandoned
    call:
      type: service
      target: user.flagInactive
      args:
        userId: "{{ input.userId }}"
```

## ‚ú® Step Anatomy

Each step can include:

```yaml
- name: stepName
  call:
    type: service | callback | ai
    target: service.method or functionName
    args: {...}
  inputSchema: {...}      # Optional validation for step input
  outputSchema: {...}     # Validation of result
  saveResultAs: varName   # Binds result for use in conditions or future args
  waitForSignal: signalName  # Blocks until received
  timeoutMs: number       # Fails or reroutes on timeout
  condition: CEL          # Conditional execution (if true, continue)
  next: stepName          # Override next step
  onFailure: fail | retry | { goto: stepName }
```

---

## üîÑ Triggers

Workflows can be triggered by:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: event
    event: user.created
    condition: CEL

  - type: manual
    condition: CEL

  - type: signal
    signal: wake
    
  - type: schedule
    cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Daily at midnight
    timezone: "UTC"
```

Triggering creates a new workflow instance, bound to input and version. Scheduled triggers can be configured statically in the workflow definition or dynamically via the schedule host API.

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

```yaml
dependsOn:
  - service: user
  - service: email
  - workflow: common.auditTrail@v2
```

Used to:

- Generate a dependency graph
- Validate available services/workflows
- Track breaking changes or drift

---

## üîê Policy Control

Workflows are subject to Okra policies:

```json
"policy.workflow.run.allowed": ["user.onboarding"]
"policy.workflow.step.maxSteps": 20
"policy.workflow.trigger.allowedEvents": ["user.*"]
"policy.workflow.callback.allowedTargets": ["kyc.validate", "plugin.*"]
"policy.workflow.schema.validation": true
```

## ‚ö° Tooling Powered by This Spec

- `okra run user.onboarding --input userId=abc123`
- `okra signal user.onboarding@v1 --id wf-123 --signal activated`
- `okra validate workflows/*.yaml`
- `okra graph` ‚Äî visualizes flow
- `okra who-calls billing.charge` ‚Äî full dependency resolution
- `okra test` ‚Äî simulates workflow execution
- `okra workflow status --id wf-123` ‚Äî query instance status
- `okra workflow list --status running` ‚Äî list active workflows

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Runtime Contract

The runtime ensures:

- Step execution conforms to input/output schemas
- CEL expressions only access valid, typed bindings
- Timeouts, retries, and signal waits are host-enforced
- All execution is logged and observable

---

## üîå Programmatic Interaction

Services interact with workflows through two host APIs:

### Workflow Host API (`workflow.*`)

Services can programmatically run workflows, send signals, and query status:

```typescript
// Run a workflow
const instanceId = await workflow.run({
  workflowId: "user.onboarding.v1",
  input: { userId: "user-123", plan: "pro" }
});

// Send a signal to a waiting workflow
await workflow.signal({
  instanceId: instanceId,
  signal: "activated",
  payload: { activatedAt: new Date() }
});

// Query workflow status
const status = await workflow.getStatus(instanceId);
if (status.status === 'failed') {
  // Handle failure
}
```

### Schedule Host API (`schedule.*`)

Services can schedule workflows to run at specific times or intervals:

```typescript
// Schedule a workflow to run daily
await schedule.triggerWorkflow({
  workflowId: "reports.daily.v1",
  cronExpression: "0 0 * * *",
  input: { reportType: "summary" }
});

// One-time scheduled workflow
await schedule.triggerWorkflow({
  workflowId: "user.followup.v1",
  at: "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
  input: { userId: "user-123" }
});
```

See the [workflow host API](./host-apis/workflow.md) and [schedule host API](./host-apis/schedule.md) documentation for complete details.

## üß© Future Extensions

- Parallel execution (`fork`, `join`)
- Subworkflows
- Typed signal schemas
- Schema inheritance or shared types
- Workflow templates or DSL for partial reuse

---

This spec forms the foundation of Okra's safe, composable workflow engine. All orchestration logic lives in these files ‚Äî not in code ‚Äî enabling unparalleled clarity, safety, and tooling leverage across engineering, AI, and enterprise governance.
