# OKRA

OKRA is an open-source backend platform that makes it simple to build and scale services, agentic workflows, and distributed systems - without boilerplate or complexity.

Define your APIs with Protobuf, write plain code, and OKRA handles the rest: auto-exposing your logic as web endpoints, gRPC services, or message-driven workflows.

With WASM isolation, actor concurrency, built-in governance, and powerful observability, OKRA brings joy back to backend development - whether you're a solo hacker or an enterprise team.
